# 1.YURU2024-MoMo

**MoMo **is an electronic percussion instrument developed based on Spresense, specifically designed to allow more people to easily enjoy music, making it easy for both professional musicians and amateur enthusiasts to pick up. The instrument uses built-in sensors to capture the movements and intensity of the performer hitting different positions, generating real-time percussion sound effects of different tones and volumes, providing a rich sound experience. We hope to break down the barriers of traditional instrument performance and make music more inclusive and easy to experience.

## Musical instrument creativity

In the field of traditional percussion, the player must have an excellent sense of rhythm and excellent muscle control. The precise tapping of each beat is a challenge for beginners and often requires a lot of practice and patience. Our goal is to simplify the learning process of percussion and make rhythm tapping as easy and fun as playing a game. In this way, we hope that every player can enjoy the original fun brought by percussion without complicated practice, so that more people can easily contact and fall in love with percussion.

## Work ideas

We plan to develop an electronic percussion instrument based on the Spresense development board, which can generate a variety of musical melodies and effects by real-time recognition of the striking position and striking pattern, meeting the needs of music creators and performers for new musical instruments. The Spresense development board is the core control unit, responsible for the collection, processing and music generation of sensor data. The pressure sensor is responsible for detecting the force of the strike, thereby affecting the volume of the generated music or the intensity of the effect. The position sensor is responsible for detecting the specific position of the strike and determining the triggering of different pitches or sounds. Finally, the generated digital music signal is converted into an audio signal through the audio output module and output to the speaker or headphones. The following is the architecture diagram of our work.

## Work Demonstration

Our work can first be used to play simple notes and melodies through a single device. By striking different positions of the percussion board, different pitches of the same timbre can be produced. The timbre can also be switched through buttons to play simple melodies.

Secondly, through the simultaneous linkage of multiple performance devices, we can also achieve the synthesis of complex melodies. Each performer is responsible for the performance of the same timbre in a complex melody. For example, a duet includes piano, trombone, violin and other instruments at the same time, and each performer is responsible for the performance of one instrument. In this way, all performers can play a beautiful duet according to the score at the same time.

# 2.YURU-DancingNotes

Have you ever dreamed of a conductor standing elegantly in front of an orchestra and conducting wonderful music? A conductor can't do it without a good orchestra, but with our instrument "Music Note", you can play music by yourself by just waving the baton, and with the leg movements, you can even play multiple parts!
